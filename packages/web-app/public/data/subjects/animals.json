    "interestingFact": "These feathered giants have the longest wingspan of any bird—up to 11 feet! The wandering albatross is the biggest of some two dozen different species.

    "photo": "img/subjects/animals/alligator.png",
    "interestingFact": "One of the weirder facts about alligators is that the sex of them is determined not by DNA but, rather, by climate. If the temperature in the baby alligator nest is warm, male alligators are born; if the temperature is cool, the babies are females.5 Mother alligators lay their eggs on a mound of dirt. When the eggs are ready to hatch, the baby alligators use an \"egg tooth\" on top of their snouts to break the shell. "

    "photo": "img/subjects/animals/armadillo.jpg",
    "interestingFact": "A common myth is that armadillos curl up into tight balls and roll away. None actively choose to roll away from predators. The only armadillos able to curl into tight balls are two species belonging to the Tolypeutes genus. These are commonly known as the Brazilian and Southern three-banded armadillos. All other armadillo species have too many plates, making this level of flexibility impossible. "

    "interestingFact": "Bats are the only flying mammal. While the flying squirrel can only glide for short distances, bats are true fliers. A bat's wing resembles a modified human hand — imagine the skin between your fingers larger, thinner and stretched. This flexible skin membrane that extends between each long finger bone and many movable joints make bats agile fliers."

The lodge can have several underwater entrances to keep out predators, with a large dry room inside that is used as a nursery and haven. The living area is well insulated by the lodge and surrounding water, so the temperature is considerably warmer inside the lodges than outside."

    "photo": "img/subjects/animals/bison.jpg",
    "interestingFact": "You can judge a bison's mood by its tail. When it hangs down and switches naturally, the bison is usually calm. If the tail is standing straight up, watch out! It may be ready to charge. No matter what a bison's tail is doing, remember that they are unpredictable and can charge at any moment. Every year, there are regrettable accidents caused by people getting too close to these massive animals. It's great to love the bison, but love them from a distance. "

    "photo": "img/subjects/animals/bufallo.jpg",
    "interestingFact": "Before delivering new calves, buffalos carry their pregnancy for roughly 11 months. This, however, happens only during the wet season. Newborn calves have a greater chance of living during the rainy season because there is more food and drinkable water compared to the dry season. Calves spend about a year with their moms before becoming more self-sufficient within the herd. When the boys reach the age of two, they leave to join bachelor groups."
