If the temperature in the baby alligator nest is warm, male alligators are born; if the temperature is cool, the babies are females.5 Mother alligators lay their eggs on a mound of dirt. When the eggs are ready to hatch, the baby alligators use an \"egg tooth\" on top of their snouts to break the shell. "

    "interestingFact": "Otters have the densest fur of any animal—as many as a million hairs per square inch in places. Otters also have particularly stinky poop, which even has its own name: spraints. It's thought to get its special odor, which some scientists describe as smelling like violets, from the seafood diet otters eat."
